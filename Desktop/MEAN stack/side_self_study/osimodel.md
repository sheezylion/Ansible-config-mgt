# What is OSI model?

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model serves as a conceptual framework, organizing network communication functions into seven distinct layers. The complexity of sending data across networks arises from the need for seamless cooperation among diverse hardware and software technologies, spanning geographical and political divides. Through the OSI data model, a universal language for computer networking is established, facilitating communication across diverse technologies via standard protocols. Each technology within a layer is expected to deliver specific capabilities and fulfill designated functions, thereby contributing effectively to the networking ecosystem.

## Benefits of the OSI model

The benefits of the OSI model are listed below:

#### Enhanced comprehension of intricate systems:

Engineers leverage the OSI model to structure and conceptualize intricate networked system architectures. They categorize each system component's operational layer based on its primary functionality, facilitating the decomposition of the system into manageable parts through abstraction. This approach aids in grasping the system as a cohesive whole.

#### Accelerated research and development:

The OSI reference model empowers engineers to gain deeper insights into their work, enabling them to discern the specific technological layer (or layers) they are targeting when designing new networked systems for intercommunication. Engineers can streamline system development by leveraging a set of standardized processes and protocols.

#### Adaptable standardization:

Rather than prescribing protocols between levels, the OSI model delineates the tasks performed by protocols, fostering standardized development of network communication. This enables rapid comprehension, construction, and deconstruction of highly intricate systems, even without prior system-specific knowledge. Additionally, it abstracts complexities, sparing engineers the need to grasp every nuance of the model. In contemporary applications, lower networking levels and protocols are often abstracted to simplify system design and development. The accompanying image illustrates the utilization of the OSI model in modern application development.

## The seven layes of the OSI model

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model was developed by the International Organization for Standardization and others in the late 1970s. It was published in its first form in 1984 as ISO 7498, with the current version being ISO/IEC 7498-1:1994. The seven layers of the model are given next.

#### Physical layer

The physical layer refers to the physical communication medium and the technologies to transmit data across that medium. At its core, data communication is the transfer of digital and electronic signals through various physical channels like fiber-optic cables, copper cabling, and air. The physical layer includes standards for technologies and metrics closely related with the channels, such as Bluetooth, NFC, and data transmission speeds.

#### Data link layer

The data link layer refers to the technologies used to connect two machines across a network where the physical layer already exists. It manages data frames, which are digital signals encapsulated into data packets. Flow control and error control of data are often key focuses of the data link layer. Ethernet is an example of a standard at this level. The data link layer is often split into two sub-layers: the Media Access Control (MAC) layer and Logical Link Control (LLC) layer.

#### Network layer

The network layer is concerned with concepts such as routing, forwarding, and addressing across a dispersed network or multiple connected networks of nodes or machines. The network layer may also manage flow control. Across the internet, the Internet Protocol v4 (IPv4) and IPv6 are used as the main network layer protocols.

#### Transport layer

The primary focus of the transport layer is to ensure that data packets arrive in the right order, without losses or errors, or can be seamlessly recovered if required. Flow control, along with error control, is often a focus at the transport layer. At this layer, commonly used protocols include the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), a near-lossless connection-based protocol, and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), a lossy connectionless protocol. TCP is commonly used where all data must be intact (e.g. file share), whereas UDP is used when retaining all packets is less critical (e.g. video streaming).

#### Session layer

The session layer is responsible for network coordination between two separate applications in a session. A session manages the beginning and ending of a one-to-one application connection and synchronization conflicts. Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB) are commonly used protocols at the session layer.

#### Presentation layer

The presentation layer is primarily concerned with the syntax of the data itself for applications to send and consume. For example, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), JavaScipt Object Notation (JSON), and Comma Separated Values (CSV) are all modeling languages to describe the structure of data at the presentation layer.

#### Application layer

The application layer is concerned with the specific type of application itself and its standardized communication methods. For example, browsers can communicate using HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), and HTTP and email clients can communicate using POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).

## How does communication happen in the OSI model?

The layers in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model are designed so that an application can communicate over a network with another application on a different device, no matter the complexity of the application and underlying systems. To do this, various standards and protocols are used to communicate with the layer above or below. Each of the layers is independent and only aware of the interfaces to communicate with the layer above and below it.

By chaining together all these layers and protocols, complex data communications can be sent from one high-level application to another. The process works as follows:

- The senderâ€™s application layer passes data communication down to the next lower layer.
- Each layer adds its own headers and addressing to the data before passing it on.
- Data communication moves down the layers until it is eventually transmitted through the physical medium.
- At the other end of the medium, each layer processes the data according to the relevant headers at that level.
- At the receiver end, data moves up the layer and is gradually unpacked until the application at the other end receives it.
