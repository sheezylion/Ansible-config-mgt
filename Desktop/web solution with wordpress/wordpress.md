# What is wordpress

If you've ever heard anyone talk about building a website, there's a good chance you've heard of WordPress. Originally launched in 2003, WordPress has since become the most popular CMS in the world, powering over 60 million websites today.

WordPress is an open-source content management system (CMS). It’s a popular tool for individuals without any coding experience who want to build websites and blogs. The software doesn’t cost anything. Anyone can install, use, and modify it for free.

## What Websites Can WordPress Make?

#### Hobby or Lifestyle Blogs

Due to WordPress's origin in the blog space, its features for this purpose are rich, including:

- The ability to differentiate between posts and pages
- A robust WYSIWYG editor for easy post creation
- Posts, tags, and categories for creating a rich content organization system
- Options for users to leave comments and you to easily moderate them

#### Professional Portfolios

You can also find a variety of themes for professional portfolios, making WordPress a great choice for showcasing your personal brand. The "Pages" functionality can be used for your homepage, About page, contact page, etc. while the "Posts" functionality can be used for the specific pieces you want to highlight — whether they're in image, text, audio, or video format.

#### Business Websites

A business website needs to get even more mileage out of WordPress, in many cases having more pages and posts than the average personal blog or site and needing additional functionality. However, due to its powerful built-in CMS capabilities and the open-source community continuing to iterate solutions, WordPress is fantastic at meeting those needs.

#### E-Commerce Stores

WordPress is particularly good for creating online stores. With e-commerce plugins such as WooCommerce, you can manage products, payments, and shipping in the back end while your visitors have an enjoyable shopping experience on the front end.

#### Mobile Applications

It can be far more convenient for some users to access your site's features through a mobile app rather than their device's browser. App development can be costly, but WordPress plugins can turn your site into an app with no hassle.

#### Membership Sites

If you're looking to monetize your efforts by restricting premium content to members only, WordPress supports plugins to create membership sites. You'll be able to manage payments, set up member levels, and monitor signups.

## Why Use WordPress?

WordPress is the beloved platform for many bloggers and businesses. In fact, more than 40% of all websites online use WordPress. Here are a few reasons why WordPress is so popular:

1. WordPress is open-source.

WordPress is an open-source platform. This means anyone can modify the source code and redistribute the software. It’s designed for people to contribute their ideas to improve the platform. There’s an open-source community that helps make WordPress even better.

2. WordPress is easy to use for a beginner.

WordPress doesn’t require a computer engineering degree. It’s actually built for non-technical people. The user interface is intuitive and friendly.

3. WordPress is SEO-friendly.

It’s not enough to just build a WordPress website. You want people to find and visit your website through search engine optimization. With SEO plugins, like Yoast SEO, you can boost your rankings with internal linking suggestions and meta description templates.

4. WordPress supports all media types.

WordPress doesn’t limit any major media types. So, you can use any combination of text, images, and videos on your website. In this competitive market for consumers’ attention, it’s good to know that the platform gives you creative freedom.

5. WordPress is secure.

Security is a major concern for businesses. With the number of data breaches happening every year, you want peace of mind that your data (and your customers’ data) will be protected. As long as you keep plugins updated and passwords secure, WordPress is one of the safest and secure CMS platforms. The platform offers several features to safeguard your website, like logging out idle users and adding two-factor authentication.

## Conclusion

Don’t be intimidated by the website creation process. While many website tools exist, WordPress offers you the flexibility to create an amazing online presence for your business.
