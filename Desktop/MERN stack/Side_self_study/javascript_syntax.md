# JAVASCRIPT SYNTAX

### What is javascript?

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. Every time a web page does more than just display static information and display timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS).

- HTML- is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
- CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.

- JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.

### javascript syntax

Understanding the basic syntax of JavaScript is fundamental for writing efficient and functional code.

#### JavaScript Variables

JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values. In this example, x, y, and z, are variables:

```
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
```

#### JavaScript Numbers

JavaScript has only one type of number. Numbers can be written with or without decimals.

```
var x = 3.14;    // A number with decimals
var y = 3;       // A number without decimals
```

#### JavaScript Strings

Strings store text. Strings are written inside quotes. You can use single or double quotes:

```
var carname = "Volvo XC60";  // Double quotes
var carname = 'Volvo XC60';  // Single quotes
```

#### Comments

Comments are used to annotate code for clarity and documentation. JavaScript supports two types of comments:

Single-line comments: // This is a single-line comment

Multi-line comments:

```
/*
This is a multi-line
comment
*/
```

### JavaScript Arrays

JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.

```
var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
```

### JavaScript Functions

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

```
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
    return p1 * p2;              // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
}
```

### Conclusion

This javascript syntax documentation covers the foundation for writing JavaScript code from variables and data types to control structures and functions, you've embarked on a path filled with endless possibilities.
